A tiny NES emulator

## Summary

This is a NES emulator, aiming to be tiny in many ways, from its resource footprint, to its code and design.

## To Do

1. ~~read 6502 docs~~
2. ~~read how NES used the 6502~~
3. come up with a better name
4. implement 6502 CPU
 * ~~memory mapping (RAM)~~
 * ~~registers + PC~~
 * ~~iNES parser~~
 * ~~opcodes + addressing modes structure~~
 * ~~iNES parser in its own module~~
 * figure out how the mappers will fit into this design
 * complete the iNES parser
 * ~~calculate cycle counts~~
 * ~~implement the rest of the instructions~~
 * illegal opcodes
