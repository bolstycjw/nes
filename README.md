## nes

A NES emulator, so that I can waste a lot of time playing old games, but also feel like I did something constructive.

I've tried to keep the code as simple as possible, in order to facilitate others in learning how the NES works.

## Limitations

Currently, only a subset of the full system has been emulated. The following limitations apply, in order of most likely to be fixed:

1. No sound
2. No second controller support
3. No PAL cartridge support

The following cartridge mappers are supported:

1. NROM (mapper 0)
2. SxROM (mapper 1)
3. UxROM (mapper 2)
4. CNROM (mapper 3)

## Building and Running

[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) is required for the graphics, and it can be installed via many different package managers:

```
$ brew install sdl2
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
$ sudo yum install SDL2-devel
```

Or see the [libsdl installation documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation) for more options.

The emulator is written in Rust, so the easiest way to build it is with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

```
$ cargo build --release
```

The emulator can then be run by supplying the path to the ROM as an argument:

```
$ target/release/nes roms/donkey_kong.nes
```

## Controller 1 Keys

```
Up     -- W
Left   -- A
Down   -- S
Right  -- D

A      -- N
B      -- M

Start  -- Enter
Select -- Space

P      -- Pause

F12    -- Reset
```

## Debugging Information

Some limited graphical debugging information can be displayed by toggling the `NES_PPU_DEBUG` environment variable. In time this will be enhanced to show more useful stuff.

```
$ NES_PPU_DEBUG=1 cargo run --release -- roms/donkey_kong.nes
```

To get full CPU debugging output printed to standard output, the `NES_CPU_DEBUG` environment variable can be toggled.

```
$ NES_CPU_DEBUG=1 cargo run -- roms/donkey_kong.nes
``` 

In order to run the nestest ROM, the CPU debugging output can be combined with the `NES_CPU_NESTEST` environment variable to also start the program counter at 0xc000.

```
$ NES_CPU_NESTEST=1 NES_CPU_DEBUG=1 cargo run -- roms/nestest.nes
``` 

## Blog Posts

I wrote a series of blog posts about developing this emulator.
